# SRBDF-Antarctic-Melt
Spatiotemporal Radar Backscatter Data Fusion (SRBDF) framework for Antarctic ice shelf surface melt monitoring.

This repository contains the codes for preprocessing, visualization and accuracy validation of the SRBDF framework, which is designed to monitor surface melt on Antarctic ice shelves.

Preprocessing (Google Earth Engine, GEE)
  Refined Lee filter for speckle noise reduction
  Cosine-based incidence angle normalization

Python Codes
  Time series visualization and statistical analysis
  Accuracy validation
